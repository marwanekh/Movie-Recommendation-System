# Movie Recommendation System

' This repository contains a VB.NET project for building a movie recommendation system. The system uses various libraries and tools for text processing and recommendation.

### Libraries Used
- **NumPy (np)**: NumPy is used for numerical computing and array operations.
- **Pandas (pd)**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **difflib**: The difflib module is used for computing similarities between sequences.
- **scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is used for machine learning tasks, including feature extraction and similarity computation.
  - **TfidfVectorizer**: Used to convert movie descriptions into feature vectors using TF-IDF.
  - **cosine_similarity**: Used to compute cosine similarity between movie descriptions.

### Project Overview
This project aims to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and similarities between movies. It utilizes a dataset containing movie descriptions and user preferences.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies.

### Files
- **MovieRecommendationSystem.vb**: VB.NET project containing the implementation of the movie recommendation system.

### Dataset
The dataset contains movie descriptions and user preferences. It is not included in this repository.

### Model Training
The model uses TF-IDF to convert movie descriptions into feature vectors and computes cosine similarity between movies based on these vectors.
